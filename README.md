# Baby Tracker App Debugging Status

## Current Situation
The application is failing to build on Android with the error: `BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 68`. This indicates a Java version incompatibility, specifically that the build process is attempting to use a Java version older than 14, despite JDK 24 being installed on the system. The widget functionality is currently not working on Android.

## Attempted Solutions
1.  **Downgraded `@bittingz/expo-widgets`:** The plugin version was changed from `^3.0.2` to `2.9.0` in `package.json`, as documentation suggested `v2` for Expo SDK 51+.
2.  **Updated `app.json` with detailed widget configuration:**
    *   Added a `widgets` array to the Android configuration for `@bittingz/expo-widgets`.
    *   Explicitly set the Android `package` name to `com.example.babytracker` in `app.json`.
3.  **Reorganized widget files:** The Android widget files (`my_widget_layout.xml`, `my_widget_info.xml`, `MyWidgetProvider.kt`) were moved to `widgets/android/main/res/layout`, `widgets/android/main/res/xml`, and `widgets/android/main/java/com/example/babytracker` respectively, and the `src` path in `app.json` was updated to `./widgets/android/main`.
4.  **Explicitly set Java 17 compatibility in `app/build.gradle`:** Added `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions` to force Java 17 for compilation.
5.  **Cleaned Gradle cache and stopped Gradle daemon:** Executed `./gradlew --stop` and `./gradlew clean` in the `android` directory to clear any cached build artifacts.

## Suggested Solution
The persistent "Unsupported class file major version 68" error, despite JDK 24 being installed and explicit Java version settings in Gradle, strongly suggests that an older JDK is still being used by the Gradle build process. This often happens when:
*   Multiple JDKs are installed on the system.
*   The system's `PATH` environment variable is configured in a way that an older Java executable is found before the desired JDK 24 installation.
*   The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable (if set) points to an older JDK.

**To resolve this, the user needs to manually inspect and correct their system's Java environment:**
*   **Check `PATH`:** Ensure that the directory containing the JDK 24 `bin` folder is prioritized in the `PATH` environment variable, or remove entries pointing to older JDKs.
*   **Verify `JAVA_HOME`:** If `JAVA_HOME` is set, confirm it points to the JDK 24 installation.
*   **Consider uninstalling older JDKs:** If not needed, removing older JDK versions can prevent conflicts.

After adjusting the Java environment, the user should try running `npx expo run:android` again.
